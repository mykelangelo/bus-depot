# Bus Depot (_â„–11_): how it works

- Drivers and Administrators can log into the system. There are buses and routes too.

- An administrator can assign free buses to the routes, free drivers to the buses, as well as vacate drivers. 

- A driver can see his place of work, and he must also confirm his new appointment.
